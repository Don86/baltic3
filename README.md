# baltic3

`baltic`(*Backronymed Adaptable Lightweight Tree Import Code*) is a phylogenetic tree visualization library. Originally developed by Dr. Gytis Dudas, a postdoc at Trevor Bedford's lab, it wraps `matplotlib` with its own proprietary `tree` object. The original Python2 version is available over at the [Bedford Lab](https://github.com/blab/baltic). That `readme`'s worth a read to explain how the class structures are set up.

* `baltic` isn't as good as `Biopython` at tree manipulation...
* But it's far superior at visualization for presentation and publication-standard figures.
* `baltic` trades off ease-of-use with flexibility. I'd call it difficult to learn, but easy to master.

The modules are:

* `baltic3` - contains the `tree`, `node` and `leaf` class definitions, and class methods.
* `baltic3_utils` - function library that contains public methods.
* `experimental` - function library that contains new methods which are still under development.

# Installation

There's no installation per se; `git clone` or download this repo to a known location (say, your desktop), and, in `Jupyter`, point your `PYTHONPATH` to it. That is, in `Jupyter`:

```
import sys
sys.path.append("path/to/baltic3")

# import the modules of this package
# Only 2 modules
import baltic3 as bt
import baltic3_utils as btu
```

# Tutorials

`baltic` is meant to be executed in Jupyter, since the final output is probably a pdf of your final image. There's a series of example notebooks in the `/tutorials` directory of this repo. In recommended order:

* [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/Don86/baltic3/blob/master/tutorials-and-examples/Tutorial1.md) - Required input format for `baltic`.
* [Tutorial 2](https://github.com/Don86/baltic3/blob/master/tutorials-and-examples/Tutorial2.md) - About the `baltic` tree object.
* [Gallery](https://github.com/Don86/baltic3/blob/master/tutorials-and-examples/Gallery.ipynb) - Gallery of examples, though so far there's only 1 example in there.
* (upcoming) - Drawing simple shapes with `matplotlib`
* (upcoming) - `matplotlib artist objects`: Drawing many, many simple shapes very quickly.

The rest of the examples are more complex examples of different visualisations.

### Is this easy to learn?

(This is the most frequently asked question I get)

Short answer: no.

Long answer: It's easy if you know how to do it, which is a perfectly accurate but perfectly useless answer. In my use cases, I set up baltic to work in `Jupyter` notebooks like the front-end trifecta of HTML/CSS/JS (or: rendering with `matplotlib`/parameter or attribute value definitions/programmatic functionality, respectively).  If that last sentence was gibberish to you, this will have a bit of a learning curve. Otherwise, if you're already familiar with that sort of paradigm, it might be that much easier.

If you're new to Python, this is not a good starting point.

* Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/Don86/baltic3/blob/master/tutorials-and-examples/Example%20-%20Viz%20H3N2%20AR.ipynb)
* Note the slight uptick in diversity at the end (~2017) of the dataset. Given that this is a log-scale, this represents quite a large jump in diversity (10X increase!).
* Is "skyline diversity" a measure? I'm not sure, because, personally, I don't find a single scalar measure of diversity that informative. I'd be more interested in *where* the diversity is occurring (i.e. which nucleotide sites are particularly mutable), and subsequent structure-function changes at the 3D structure level that could result from changes in mutation. Given that this is the HA sequence, some immunology contextual information (where antibodies tend to target) would be useful as well.
