# baltic3
Python 3 version of Baltic: the Backronymed Adaptable Lightweight Tree Import Code. The original Python2 version is available over at the [Bedford Lab](https://github.com/blab/baltic).

## To Do

 - Find a way to accept just a tree string, without dates. IIRC when it currently can accept a tree string, but the resulting tree object won't have tip names, or something like that. Not sure if the tip/node attributes will be properly read as well (e.g. bootstrap values)
 - Perform tip-to-mrca-to-tip computations
